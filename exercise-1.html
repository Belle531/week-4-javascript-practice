  <h1> JavaScript 1 </h1>
  <p> When we make a webpage, JavaScript can go into a &lt;script&gt; tag. One big part of JavaScript is called
    "imperative programming." This means that you are creating commands telling the computer what to do. The first
    "command" we will learn is </p>
  <p>
    <code> document.write("Hello"); </code>
  </p>

  <p>P.S. (The proper way to say "command" is "statement". JavaScript programs are composed of a series of JavaScript
    "statements")</p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <p> Let's start with some examples!</p>
  <script>
    document.write("Hello from JavaScript! ");
    document.write("I am telling you... ");
    document.write("don't forget the quotation marks! ");
    document.write("Every single letter and character is important. ");
    document.write('Very important. ');


  </script>

  <h3>You try it!</h3>
  <p>Now you try! Fill out the 3 <code>document.write();</code> statements below with your own text. Then write 5 more
    statements of your own, for a total of 8! </p>
  <script>
    document.write("I am Tu es Belle  ");
    document.write("Meaning You are Beatiful... ");
    document.write("Therefore I am Beatiful  ");
    document.write("Hello to JavaScript!  ");
    document.write("I am telling you I am going to learn JacaScript like the back of my hand Cassandra Moore.  ");
    document.wrte("I know a little bit about mathematical functions in JavaScript. But this is making my HEAD hurt lol  ");
    document.wrtie("This mean I will not be getting any sleep  ");
    document.write("What making my head hurt is the math most people just to the baisc everyday math.  ")
    document.wrtie ("Math used in JavaScript is Linear Algebara.  ")


  </script>
